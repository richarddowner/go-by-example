/*
We often need our programs to perform operations on
collections of data, like selecting all items that
satisfy a given predicate or mapping all items to a
new collection with a custom function.

In some languages it's idiomatic to use generic data
structures and algorithms. Go does not support generics;
in Go it's common to provide collection functions if 
and when they are specifically needed for your program
and data types.

Here are some example collection functions for slices
of strings.

* Note that in some cases it may be clearest to just
inline the collection-manipulating code directly,
instead of creating and calling a helper function.
